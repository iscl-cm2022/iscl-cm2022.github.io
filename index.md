This is the course page
for the seminar course
_Computational Morphology_
at the [Department of Linguistics](http://sfs.uni-tuebingen.de),
[University of Tübingen](http://uni-tuebingen.de).

This is a seminar course covering a wide range of different
approaches for computational processing of natural language
morphology. We will cover both rule-based (finite-state) systems
and data-driven models of both supervised and unsupervised
morphological processing.

The course is organized as two parts.
First part constitutes a series of lectures and tutorials, 
where fundamental topics and tools will be introduced.
The second part follows a seminar format, where we will read
a selection of influential and/or recent papers from the literature,
and discuss them in the class.
The participants will also be required to complete small projects.

The questions of interest for this course include:

- Can we (precisely and computationally) describe morphology of a language?
- Can we, or to what extent, segment words in natural languages to
  segments that correspond to morphemes?
- What is a word anyway? How can we discover words in speech, or texts
  written without clear hints to word boundaries?
- Can we build models of morphological processing purely data-driven
  manner? Do we still need rule-based models/descriptions of
  natural languages?
- Can we help document low-resource, endangered language with the help
  of computational methods?
- What makes a language morphologically complex or rich? Can we
  quantify morphological complexity? Is it relevant to natural
  language processing (e.g., with modern NLP systems)?

Grading will be based on class participation and homeworks (6ECTS).
Further course credits can be obtained by 
a term project described in a term paper (9ECTS)
within the scope of the course.

## Requirements

There are no formal requirements.
However, this is an advanced course where the participants are expected 
to read and understand a broad range of topics including 
finite-state automata and various machine learning methods.
